# ⚓ Project Rakshak: The Smart Flood Rescue Network

### "A beacon of hope when every second counts."

## 🌊 The Problem
[cite_start]Floods affect over 250 million people annually. [cite: 8] [cite_start]In events like the 2018 Kerala floods, communication networks fail, leaving rescue teams without real-time data on victim locations. [cite: 15, 18]

## 🛠 Our Solution
[cite_start]Rakshak is a self-powered, intelligent system designed to detect and verify survivors using a decentralized LoRa mesh network. [cite: 24, 72] [cite_start]It bypasses fragile cellular towers to provide actionable intelligence to rescuers. [cite: 72]

## 🚀 Google Tech Stack (TECHSPRINT 2025)
- [cite_start]**Google Gemini Pro:** Analyzes sensor fusion data (thermal + sound) to verify human presence and prioritize high-risk victims. [cite: 120]
- [cite_start]**Firebase Realtime Database:** Acts as the central hub to sync GPS coordinates and victim status instantly. [cite: 31, 45]
- [cite_start]**Google Maps Platform:** Visualizes the rescue web, allowing teams to see live victim locations on a map. 

## ⚙️ Key Features
- [cite_start]**Autonomous Detection:** Uses thermal, motion, and sound recognition. [cite: 27, 28]
- [cite_start]**LoRa Mesh Communication:** Works without internet or mobile networks. [cite: 21, 32]
- [cite_start]**Self-Sustaining Power:** Runs on solar and kinetic energy. [cite: 41, 75]
- [cite_start]**Smart Stability:** GPS drift correction ensures accurate localization. [cite: 37, 76]
